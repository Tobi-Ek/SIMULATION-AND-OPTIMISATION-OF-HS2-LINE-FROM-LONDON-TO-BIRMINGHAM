# SIMULATION-AND-OPTIMISATION-OF-HS2-LINE-FROM-LONDON-TO-BIRMINGHAM

Given certain constraints such that the average delay time should not be higher than half the scheduled time between consecutive trains, this paper focused on maximising the number of trains operating per hour. A detailed simulation is captured to reflect train trips from London Old Oak Commons to Birmingham Interchange station. 

The simulated model in this paper factored in an induced temporary break down due to electrical malfunction with a 30-minute delay for fixing the problem as well as delay caused by random events and reports the distribution of the actual delayed times.
